### What is the difference between crossed random effects and a multiple membership model?

Multiple membership is not the same as crossed random effects: In a crossed random effects model, each observation can be associated with a **single** level of multiple, independent random effects (i.e. the random effects do not have to be nested). In a multiple membership model, each observation can be associated with **multiple** levels of a single random effect.

`lme4` supports fully crossed random effects (whereas e.g. `nlme` does not), but not multiple membership models. `lmerMultiMember` adds support for multiple membership models to `lme4`, while still supporting fully crossed random effects at the same time.


### I tried using another package to plot/summarize/etc. an `lmerMultiMember` model, but it didn't work?

Since `lmerMultiMember` model objects behave much like `lme4` model objects (i.e. they "inherit" the model class from `lme4`) you can generally use them as if they are the same. However, some packages (e.g. `sjPlot`) are very strict about recognizing models and will sometimes not accept `lmerMultiMember` models.

There is an easy workaround that usually works (no guarantees though!) which is to force the `lmerMultiMember` to have the same class as an `lme4` or `lmerTest` model:

```{r eval = FALSE}
class(m_lmer) <- "lmerMod"  # for lmer models
class(m_glmer) <- "glmerMod"  # for glmer models
class(m_lmer) <- "lmerModLmerTest"  # if you have lmerTest installed
```

Keep in mind that this change is superficial; it is just a trick and some things may still not work.


### Why is this functionality not part of `lme4` already?

`lme4` did not have this functionality originally because it is not the most common use-case and it turns out to be kind of hard to implement in an elegant way. It is probably unhelpful for most `lme4` users if the syntax has to be altered to support 

Another reason not to try to subsume `lmerMultiMember` into `lme4` is that the latter is kind of in maintenance mode, with most development focusing on compatibility and bugfixes, while `lmerMultiMember` is still a little experimental and might still undergo major changes.
